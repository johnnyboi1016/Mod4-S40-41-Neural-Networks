    "\n",
    "Let's start with an easy example to get an idea of what a neural network is. Imagine a city has 10 ice cream vendors. We would like to predict what the sales amount is for an ice cream vendor given certain input features. Let's say you have several features to predict the sales for each ice cream vendor: the location, the way the ice cream is priced, and the variety in the ice cream offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the input feature *location*. You know that one of the things that really affect the sales is how many people will walk by the ice cream shop, as these are all potential customers. And realistically, the volume of people passing is largely driven by the *location*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's look at the input feature *pricing*. How the ice cream is priced really tells us something about the affordability, which will affect sales as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Last, let's look at the *variety in offering*. When an ice cream shop offers a lot of different ice cream flavors, this might be perceived as a higher quality shop just because customers have more flavors to choose from (and might really like that!). On the other hand, *pricing* might also affect perceived quality: customers might feel that the quality is higher if the prices are higher. This shows that several inputs might affect one hidden feature, as these features in the so-called \"hidden layer\" are called. \n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, all features will be connected with all nodes in the hidden layer, and weights will be assigned to the edges (more about this later), as you can see in the network below. That's why networks like this are also referred to as **densely connected neural networks**. \n",

The input features very much take a form of a \"classical\" dataset: observations are rows, features are columns.

Deep learning was really able to drastically improve machine performance when using unstructured data!\n",

The larger the batch, the better the approximation; however, it is also true that the batch will take longer to process and will still result in only one update.

    "\n",
    "The key takeaways from this section include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neural networks are powerful models that can be customized and tweaked using various amounts of nodes, layers, ...\n",
    "* The most basic neural networks are single-layer densely connected neural networks, which have very similar properties as logistic regression models\n",
    "* Compared to more traditional statistics and ML techniques, neural networks perform particularly well when using unstructured data\n",
    "* Apart from densely connected networks, other types of neural networks include convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and generative adversarial neural networks \n",
    "* When working with image data, it's important to understand how image data is stored when working with them in Python\n",
    "* Logistic regression can be seen as a single-layer neural network with a sigmoid activation function\n",
    "* Neural networks use loss and cost functions to minimize the \"loss\", which is a function that summarizes the difference between the actual outcome (eg. pictures contain santa or not) and the model prediction (whether the model correctly identifies pictures with santas)\n",
    "* Backward and forward propagation are used to estimate the so-called \"model weights\"\n",
    "* Adding more layers to neural networks can substantially increase model performance\n",
    "* Several activations can be used in model nodes, you can explore with different types and evaluate how it affects performance"

In this section, you'll learn why deeper networks sometimes lead to better results, and we'll generalize what you have learned before to get your matrix dimensions right for deep networks.

In this section, you'll see that you can actually build a smaller but deeper neural network with exponentially less hidden units which performs even better than a network with more hidden units. The reason for this is that learning happens in each layer, and adding more layers (even with fewer limits) can lead to very powerful predictions! You'll learn about matrix notation for these deep networks and how to build a network like that from scratch.\n"

    "\n",
    "The hyperbolic tangent (or tanh) function goes between -1 and +1, and is in fact a shifted version of the sigmoid function, with formula $ a=\\dfrac{\\exp(z)- \\exp(-z)}{\\exp(z)+ \\exp(-z)}$. For intermediate layers, the tanh function generally performs pretty well because, with values between -1 and +1, the means of the activations coming out are closer to zero! "

    "A disadvantage of both tanh and sigmoid activation functions is that when $z$ gets quite large or small, the derivative of the slopes of these functions become very small, generally 0.0001. This will slow down gradient descent. You can see in the tanh plot that this already starts happening for values of $z > 2$ or $z < 2$. The next few activation functions will try to overcome this issue. \n",

    "Deep representations are really good at automating what used to be a tedious process of feature engineering. Not only would modelers need to have complex programming and analytical skills, they would also often require domain knowledge in order to manually build features that would then be passed on to a regression or classification algorithm. With deep representations, this time consuming process is often severely diminished. \n",

    "- third: word recognition\n",
    "- fourth: sentence recognition\n",
